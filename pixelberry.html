				<div class = "project-description" id = "pixelberry-project-description">My time at Pixelberry Studios was full of fun and exciting endeavors. As a designer, I worked with the team that supports the Top Grossing 100 mobile game <i><b>Choices: Stories You Play</b></i>, other ‘more secretive’ projects, and lead higher internal design departmental initiatives and responsibilites. From spearheading UXR methods, to making production process improvements and advocating for holistic user-focused design directions, I worked closely with many departments to design, launch, and maintain various external features and internal tools, and figuring out how to best reach teamwide alignment in doing so. Feel free to check out some the work I did below!</div>

					 				I lead the holistic review and documentation of the feature's design throughout the production process, fronting the coordination with engineers, QA, and other designers to communicate various subsystems and resolving upcoming issues during development and launch. <a href="https://www.pixelberrystudios.com/blog/2020/7/21/vip-access" id = "hyperlink" target = "_blank"><i><u>You can read more about VIP Access here!</u></i></a>
					 				<br><br>
					 				Since the feature's early beginnings, I worked closely with the Head of Design to map out the initial flow of our VIP subscription model. We conducted research and rapid iteration through numerous paper prototypes and internal user testing sessions. I also designed and created mocks, prototypes, and implemented visual assets and animations within our game's engine for the feature.
				 				</div>
				 				<div class = "desktop-section-description vip-desktop-description">
					 				There was a large amount of research done for the design of this feature. Instead of starting with lo-fi wires and prototypes, we chose to move quicker with our iterations and data gathering through paper prototypes. Working with paper allowed us greater flexibility to play with flows and implement feedback changes directly on the spot.
					 				<br><br>
					 				We conducted various internal user testing sessions with the paper prototypes, and continued resolving clarity, feel, and conceptual issues with each iteration. Overall this process was extremely enlightening and fun!
				 				</div>
				 				<div class = "desktop-section-description vip-desktop-description">
					 				Since the subscription model affects a large aspect of the app, there were a lot of separate flows and systems of the design that needed to be identified, connected, and mapped out. Working with the Design Head, we designed these complex systems towards one holistic model while tweaking our work based on the feedback we’d get from our testing sessions along the way.
					 				<br><br>
					 				Once we finished with our research and ideations, I lead the review, organization, and communication of the VIP design systems between multiple departments throughout the development process. I remained the owner of overseeing the high-level design system of this feature and resolving upcoming issues throughout launch.
				 				</div>
				 				<div class = "desktop-section-description vip-desktop-description">
					 				In addition to researching and designing the subscription skeleton model, I created documentation, user diagrams, feature boards, and prototypes to communicate the design intent, logic, and dependencies of the different systems across the entire team.
					 				<br><br>
					 				I worked with other designers to organize visual assets, and designed and implemented animations to improve the feel of the user’s key ‘VIP’ experience. I was also the primary designer responsible for testing the feature during development so that it upheld the intended design quality.
				 				</div>
				 				<div class = "desktop-section-description vip-desktop-description">
					 				To make the VIP experience pop, I designed various transitions and animations for key points of the subscription flow. This included animating assets, playing with particle effects, and experimenting with adding motion to static parts of the screen. All this was done to use motion to guide the player’s attention during special and rewarding moments, like the first time a user becomes a subscriber.
					 				<br><br>
					 				In addition to creating animation mockups, I also spent time implementing these animations directly into our game engine. I worked closely with engineers to create a development environment where designers had more control over controlling animation variables, like timing, to reduce development overhead.

				 				<div class = "desktop-section-description large-card-desktop-description">
					 				One feature I enjoyed redesigning was the game’s detailed book view, also known as the Large Card. The Large Card is a view that players see often as it holds information about the state of the book and chapter they’re playing. As part of redesigning our storefront, I redesigned the Large Card to feel more modern and reduce redundant flows.
					 				<br><br>
					 				I took opportunities to give it a visual upgrade, simplify navigation, added modern transitions, overhaul our text to increase accessibility, and improve information display to be more meaningful to users. The outcome of this redesign informed the design direction of future features in the storefront redesign initiative. 
				 				</div>
				 				<div class = "desktop-section-description large-card-desktop-description">
					 				Since the Large Card keeps track of the player’s state of play per book/chapter, this view had numerous states and various entry points from the rest of the app. My main goal was identifying how to make interacting with the Large Card more meaningful to the user. After doing competitor research and working with product, we ended up significantly simplifying the flow to reduce leading players to unnecessary views and information.
					 				<br><br>
					 				The amount of states for the feature were also reduced. I updated existing logic to account for these changes and other dependencies. I also took this opportunity to increase accessibility in our font and text-contrast ratio, and altered our UX language to be more meaningful.
				 				</div>
				 				<div class = "desktop-section-description large-card-desktop-description">
					 				Keeping with my ‘more meaningful’ goal, I wanted to improve the visual heiarchy of the Large Card to match the significance of the content. We also wanted to keep the feel of our app ‘light and bright’. This led me to design the cover art larger, create a sleeker visual style for our HUD and icons, establish a new type system, and integrate many modern design patterns of gradient usage and negative space.
					 				<br><br>
					 				I also revisited our standard rules for aspect-ratio to improve the feel of our narrow devices. Much of these visual choices became the anchor in establishing the style of our storefront redesign going froward.
				 				</div>
				 				<div class = "desktop-section-description large-card-desktop-description">
					 				Throughout my design process, I created various low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity mocks to communicate with other departments on the feature’s design intent and goals. I created assets and developed new cover art templates for internal use.
					 				<br><br>
									I also created many interactive prototypes to quickly test out early-flow navigation and to demonstrate polished transitions, animations, and the final user journey of changing between states. As the design owner of this feature, I also wrote the design documentation  and made any necessary deliverables that could help communicate the feature better across the team.
