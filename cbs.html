My time was spent on redesigning GameSpot's website. GameSpot went through a redesign 3 years ago, but the profile page had been neglected for a long time. My task was to redesign the profile page on GameSpot to improve the user experience, flow, and engageability. Unfortunately, I can not show any of my designs here but I can talk about my processes behind them.</div>

						 				I began to create mockups of the design with higher-fidelity levels while iterating based on teamwide feedback. I started designing for desktop first and moved onto mobile layout afterwards (although in hindsight there would’ve been great benefits to design for mobile-first).
