My time was spent on redesigning GameSpot's website. GameSpot went through a redesign 3 years ago, but the profile page had been neglected for a long time. My task was to redesign the profile page on GameSpot to improve the user experience, flow, and engageability. Unfortunately, I can not show any of my designs here but I can talk about my processes behind them.</div>
